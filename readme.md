# Trivia Odyssey
A simple and fun location based landmark/tourist attraction identificaiton app, which adds fun little trivia quiz to this location, so you learn and explore at the same time.
Here is a short list of things we've done:
- Created a dataset of tourist attractions and landmarks around rochester (our current location)
- Track the users current live location and show a list of cards containing tourist attractions around them
- Clicking on that tourist attraction allows the user to get the direction to that place and a fun trivia question, which lets them learn something new about it.
- Powered by Auth0 to enable user login and logout
